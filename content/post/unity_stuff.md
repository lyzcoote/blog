# Still WIP! Except more updates and better quality!

## I suck at 3D and Unity

*Yeah, that's the truth*

But hey, I can always try to learn!

Well, I got interested again at Unity and 3D modeling, especially VRChat Avatars and Worlds.
For now tho, I'm starting again at Avatars, to be exact, at the Wickerbeast that my friend [Dat](https://www.datcomms.com/) made for me!
Let's try to add some props, like the sword that is already in my Protogen made by other friend [Mimi](https://mimisdesign.eu/).

## The sword

So first of all, I need to get the sword from the Protogen to the Wickerbeast, and that's not that hard, I just need to export the sword from the Protogen and import it to the Wickerbeast, but I need to make sure that the sword is in the right position, so I need to move it a bit, and that's it, I got the sword in the Wickerbeast!

## Some results!

Here are some results of the sword in the Wickerbeast!
